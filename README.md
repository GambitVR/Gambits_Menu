Gorilla Tag Mod Menu by GambitVR

This is a simple but powerful mod menu for Gorilla Tag, built by GambitVR. It comes with a few fun mods to mess around with, and I'm always open to adding more based on your requests!

What to Know:

Just drag and drop the .dll into your plugins folder and you're good to go.

If the game or menu updates, you'll probably need to re-download the latest version of the menu.

Want a specific mod added? Drop your ideas in the comments on my YouTube channel and Iâ€™ll try to make it happen.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!
